<p>
I'm a software engineer with a serious passion for technology. I thrive on building new things and automating daily tasks to make life a little easier and a lot more efficient. My experience spans both the private and public         sectors, giving me a versatile skill set and a unique perspective on problem-solving. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me diving into a new tech trend or tinkering with a personal projectâ€”because for me, learning and creating  isn't just a job, it's a hobby! ðŸš€
